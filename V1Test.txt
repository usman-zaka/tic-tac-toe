Overview:
First step is to code the welcome message

Hello! Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!
You will be playing against another human! So bring a friend!
Player 1 is X and Player 2 is O!
You can make move by first indicating which row you want the move and then which column!
A forward slash means that spot is empty and you can place a move there!
Player 1 can start the game by making a move!

The above is the expected outcome, with a 1 second delay between each line. 

Actual Outcome:
