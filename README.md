# Tic Tac Toe
The MATLAB project created by Muhammad Usman Zaka

README
 
 
Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe game! This is a text-based version of the game developed as a project for ENG 1002.
This README file includes instructions on how to run and play the associated game.

This game is meant to demonstrate my programming journey and how I started as a beginner and created a text-based game like this.
