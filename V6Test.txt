Overview:
We need to implement a play again feature so the user can simply indicate they want to play again and the game will just restart rather than
them having to run the program again and again. 

Expected Outcome:
Once the game is over, the user is asked if they want to play again and if they do, the game will restart. 

Actual Outcome:
Indeed the game is over, the user is asked if they want to play again and if they do, the game does restart.
