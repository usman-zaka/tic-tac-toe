Overview:
We need to code a function that will display the board (3x3 Matrix). The reason we are implementing this with a function is because we will need to display the board every time a turn is made. 

Expected Outcome:

For now, it should just display a 3x3 matrix full of forward slashes like the following:

"/"    "/"    "/"
"/"    "/"    "/"
"/"    "/"    "/"

The forward slash represents an empty spot where a player can make a move. 

Actual Outcome:

It indeed displays a 3x3 matrix representing an empty board full of forward slashes like the following:

"/"    "/"    "/"
"/"    "/"    "/"
"/"    "/"    "/"
